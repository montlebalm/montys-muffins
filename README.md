# Slack Poopin

Slash Commands to palpably prove in print your periodic poingant potty practices.

I don't recommend using these commands. You should not even install them. You should just stop reading this and go on with your day.

## Commands

`/poopin`: keep everyone informed.

`/whopooped [today] or [yesterday]`: report for the day.

`/flush`: reset your day to 0 to cover up any accidents.
